# 📘 Assignment 3: JavaScript Practice with Conditionals, Strings, and Math

✅ Task 1: Random Number Guessing Game

Description:
Generate a random integer between 1 and 10. Prompt the user to guess the number. Use conditionals to check if the guess is correct, too high, or too low.

Example Output:

Guess a number between 1 and 10: 7
Too low! Try again.

Hints:

- Use Math.random() to generate a random number between 1 and 10.
- Use Math.floor() to convert the decimal to an integer.
-	Use prompt() to get user input and alert() or console.log() to display messages. ￼

⸻

✅ Task 2: String Analyzer

Description:
Prompt the user to enter a sentence. Analyze the string to determine:

- The total number of characters.
- The number of words.
- Whether the sentence contains the word “JavaScript”. ￼

Example Output:

Enter a sentence: I love JavaScript programming.
Total characters: 29
Total words: 4
Contains 'JavaScript': true

Hints:

 - Use .length to get the number of characters.
 - Use .split(" ") to divide the sentence into words.
 - Use .includes("JavaScript") to check for the presence of the word. ￼

⸻

✅ Task 3: Math Function Application

Description:
Prompt the user to enter three numbers. Use Math functions to:

- Find the smallest and largest numbers.
- Calculate the average and round it to the nearest whole number.

Example Output:

Enter three numbers: 5, 10, 15
Smallest number: 5
Largest number: 15
Average (rounded): 10

Hints:

- Use Math.min() and Math.max() to find the smallest and largest numbers.
- Calculate the average by summing the numbers and dividing by 3.
- Use Math.round() to round the average. ￼

⸻

✅ Task 4: Random Password Generator

Description:
Generate a random 8-character password consisting of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits.

Example Output:

Generated password: aB3dE9gH

Hints:

- Create a string containing all possible characters.
- Use a loop to select random characters from this string.
- Use Math.random() and Math.floor() to select random indices. ￼ ￼

⸻

✅ Task 5: Age Group Classifier

Description:
Prompt the user to enter their age. Classify them into an age group:

- Child: 0–12
- Teen: 13–17
- Adult: 18–64
-	Senior: 65+

Example Output:

Enter your age: 30
You are classified as: Adult

Hints:
	•	Use if...else if...else statements to determine the age group.
	•	Ensure the input is converted to a number before comparison. ￼
